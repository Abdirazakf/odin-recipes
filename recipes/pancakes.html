        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar</b>: Just three tablespoons offwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
            <li><b>Leaveners</b>: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b>: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
            <li><b>Buttermilk</b>: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
            <li><b>Milk</b>: Whole milk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs</b>: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes</li>
            <li><b>Butter</b>: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
        </ul>
