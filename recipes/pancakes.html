        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>As convenient as a store bought mix can be, every home cook should have a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their arsenal.
            Here's a classic buttermilk pancake recipe to get light, fluffy, moist, and rich buttermilk pancakes.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just three tablespoons offwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar 
                if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter
                 to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Whole milk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients</strong>: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients 
                until right before you cook the pancakes</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes</strong>: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter 
                onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
