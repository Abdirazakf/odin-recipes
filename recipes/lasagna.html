        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the meat sauce</strong>: In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat
                until the meat is well browned. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar,
                basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and half the fresh parsley. Simmer for at
                least one hour, stirring occasionally, to develop flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the lasagna noodles for about 8 to 10 minutes.
                Drain them and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Set them aside so they don't stick.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the ricotta mixture</strong>: In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg, remaining parsley, and a pinch of salt. Mix
                until it's well blended and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer the lasagna</strong>: Spread 1½ cups of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
                lengthwise over the sauce, then spread on half the ricotta mixture. Top with about a third of the
                mozzarella, followed by 1½ cups of sauce and a sprinkle of Parmesan. Repeat the layers. Finish with
                the remaining noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan</li>
            <li><strong>Cover with foil and bake</strong>: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil, being careful not to let
                the foil touch the cheese. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for an
                additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Let the lasagna rest before serving</strong>: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes before cutting into it.
                This helps the layers set and makes for easier slicing.</li>
